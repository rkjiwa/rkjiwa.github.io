Hi, I'm Rahim and this is my blog.

First, let me tell you a little bit about myself. I was born on a cold but lovely day in January 1991 in Toronto, Ontario. I like any normal child had developed a number of interests, most notably: business (finance, marketing, entrepreneurship and strategy), technology, science and sports. These interests stay with me throughout my time at the University of Waterloo. At Waterloo, I studied economics and spent my extra time: getting exposed to: entrepreneurship (at Velocity), learning about business and technology, and developing a thirst for solving challenging problems. Recently, I moved back to Toronto and am looking to solve some new problems and embark on the next adventure.

Here I'm going to write my thoughts on subjects primarily dealing with: business, technology, science, media and sports. I'll also share other information that I find interesting or informative.
