title: PDF Extraction with PyPDF2
---

Another tool that can be used for PDF extraction in Python is PyPDF2. It is fairly easy to use, however I found Tika performed better for extraction. When using PyPDF2 it often returned a messy output. Below is an example code of how you can use it. You can also check out the documentation here: Link to PyPDF2 Documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/)
