title: Pandas Profiling for Rapid Exploratory Data Analysis
---

I recently learned about this python package called Pandas Profiling, which has proved to be useful for exploratory data analysis. 

It can be utilized on a dataset to provide: overview information, warnings about potential issues, counts and descriptive statistics about each variables, shows correlations among variables, details about missing values, and the head and tail of the dataset.

It is useful because rather than having to go through and analyzing each of the variables yourself, this package can give you a summary enabling you to get a broader picture faster. Letting you spend more time on other parts of your analysis.

More information can be found at the [package's GitHub page](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling). You can also see a sample that they provide on the [Titanic Dataset Here.](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/examples/titanic/titanic_report.html)
