title: Redundancy
---

The world suffers from many things, and one that I find especially horrifying is the information overload.

There are many reasons one may oppose this modern phenomenon. However, it doesn't bug me because it can be mentally taxing, or because it is suspected to be one of the leading causes for distraction. I abhor it because it seduces people to live a life lacking imagination and full of redundancy; opposite sides to the same coin.

This world is one that craves interconnectivity. It craves being social. In fact, such a large quantity of social interaction takes place in a digital space, that when one tries to unplug, they feel like Tom Hanks in "Castaway" after he loses Wilson. Cold, sad, and alone. The social nature of technology is something I don't have a problem with. I think it's wonderful that you can get in touch with anyone in the world instantly, or get almost any piece of information at your fingertips. So long as you're not living in the matrix, technology has produced some of the greatest tools available, tools which you'd be foolish not to take advantage of. My problem lies with the fact that we are fed the same, sometimes meaningless, information and are not led to expand our minds.

I don't care to hear about celebrity dating stories; they all have the same narratives. I don't care to hear the same story about how some app became super popular. I don't care to keep hearing the same tales about Steve Jobs. If you haven't taken anything from the Stanford speech the first or second time, stop watching it. The repetition does not make it any more profound. No reminder is going to make it any more profound, so stop shoving it down my throat. If I want a reminder, I will go look it up. I mean what else is Google for?

Media is supposed to be about providing information. To inform is to give someone knowledge; this has the implication that it is new or unfamiliar knowledge. Telling someone something they know or something irrelevant (or unimportant in any way shape or form important) is not providing them with any information. Provide new value! Don't sell the same product in a different wrapper. Have some integrity. 

I realize not every member of the media is guilty to providing useless information. If you aren't, then keep up the good work! We need more people like you. On the other hand, if you are, well I have nothing more to say to you. To everyone who consumes information, only listen to the mediums that provide you with value. You owe them nothing. It doesn't matter how they give you value. If you enjoy what they are giving you and it is enriching your life, that is what is important. Just think critically about what you are consuming and make it useful to yourself.

Note: This rant was inspired by seeing a re-posted blog post. So annoying, for real. Feel free to re-read this and incorporate your own profanity -- my first draft was laced with it. You have to keep your editors busy ;).
