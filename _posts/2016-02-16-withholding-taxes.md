title: Withholding Taxes

It is extremely common for investors to want international exposure in line with their diversification strategy. This typically leads to investment in foreign equities or to get exposure to foreign markets by an instrument like an ETF. If you are receiving dividends from one of these foreign investments, you may notice that the amount you are receiving from your dividends is lower than the amount expected. This is due to something called withholding taxes.

What is a withholding tax? It’s exactly like what it sounds like it’s collected (or withheld) by the corporation that is paying you (whether via a dividend or salary), that is then paid to the government as income tax. It serves as a mechanism to prevent tax evasion and its most common applications are to employment income and investment income. 

Focusing on the dividend application, let’s go over an example. Say you are a Canadian investor with a TFSA and you own 100 shares in MSFT (Microsoft Corporation). They have declared a dividend with an ex-dividend date of February 16th, 2016 with a payment date of March 10th, 2016. The dividend they have declared is a cash dividend of $0.36 per share. This means that your cash dividend income should amount to $36 without accounting for the withholding tax. Let’s say the specific withholding tax in this case is 15%; in this case you’d receive $30.6 ($36 * (1 – 0.15)) with the Taxman getting $5.40.

Let me share just some quick notes on withholding taxes. Depending on the paperwork filled out with the IRS, you may be charged either 30% or 15% in taxes. It’s 15% if you fill out the W-8BEN form with the IRS. Also, treatments can vary depending on the account you use. For example, your dividends from US stocks will be subject to withholding taxes with a TFSA; however, if you held them in an RRSP the IRS would not collect withholding taxes. It’s important that you know whether or not you are subject to these taxes and plan for them accordingly within your investment strategy.
