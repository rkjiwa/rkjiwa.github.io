Hey, I'm Rahim and this is my blog.

Here I'm going to mainly talk about business (finance, marketing, strategy, economics, and entrepreneurship) and occasionally other topics I find interesting.

Let me just tell you a little bit about myself. I love business; I've loved it since childhood. I followed this love and graduated from [The University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca) with a degree in economics with a specialization in finance. I also have gathered several years of marketing experience and have also been surrounded by entrepreneurship my entire life. Some of my other interests include: science, technology, design, sports, and music. For more about me you can follow me on [Twitter @rkjiwa](http://twitter.com/rkjiwa) or on [Linkedin](ca.linkedin.com/in/rahimjiwa).

I hope you enjoy this as much as I do. 

Cheers,

Rahim
