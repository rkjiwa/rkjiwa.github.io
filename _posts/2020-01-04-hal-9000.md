title: HAL 9000 - An Ideal of Computer Human Interaction
---

Hal 9000, from 2001: A Space Odyssey, is what we should be striving for when trying to create a computer that can talk to humans. The reason for this is that it includes 3 major components of understanding: it can analyze what it being said or the text, it can gather the context and tone of voice, and it can pay attention to the body language of the person that it is interacting with. All are items that humans perform without thinking when interacting with one another. In order to be able to seamlessly interact with computers or AIs, we are going to need a way for them to combine the different aspects of communication together so they can process the data closer to a human level of understanding. Let's just hope in the future they aren't as sinister.
